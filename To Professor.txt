Dear reviewing professor.
Throughout the time that we have been given this assignment, I have been very ill, presumably with a corona virus.

It so happened that by the time I was more or less recovered, I immediately had technical problems with the assignment, so I had to wait until the last day.

I wish to further refine and correct some of the aspects I have not done.

I would be extremely grateful if I am given the opportunity to do so.
